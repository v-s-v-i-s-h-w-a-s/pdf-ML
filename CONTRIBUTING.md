## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! A few guidelines to get started:

- Branch from `main` and open pull requests for changes.
- Keep changes small and focused. Add tests where practical.
- If your change requires new dependencies, update `backend/requirements-dev.txt` or `frontend/package.json`.
- Use the included GitHub Actions workflow for CI; it runs basic Python checks and installs frontend dependencies.

If you're adding features that require system binaries (Tesseract, Poppler), document the install steps in the README.

Happy hacking!
